#JKSV Translation File
#File can be placed and named "/JKSV/trans.txt" for testing without building
#Format is: stringName = index, "string"
#You only need to translate "string", there is no need to touch the other two parameters.
#'%s' is replaced with game titles and paths. '#', '*', '>', etc change text color. [x] are replaced with button glyphs
#This is exported from JKSV itself to make adding strings to this easier.
#It can also export already made translations with new strings if added, cutting down work for everyone.
#If there are issues with spacing, line breaking, untranslatable English text, etc let me know in a git issue or your pull request.
