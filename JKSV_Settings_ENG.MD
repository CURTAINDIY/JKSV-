# JKSV's Settings menu options and what they do:
1. **Empty Trash Bin**: Empties the trash folder of all backups moved to it. Running this now and then is important if you choose to use the trash bin option, which is enabled by default.

2. **Check for Updates**: Checks JKSV's Github release page for any new updates and downloads it for you.

3. **Set JKSV Output Folder**: Changes the folder in which JKSV stores your save backups. Remember to end the path with a slash so this works properly.

4. **Edit Blacklisted Titles**: Opens a menu that allows you to select and remove titles that are hidden in JKSV's title selection menu.

5. **Delete All Save Backups**: Wipes JKSV's folder clean for you to start fresh.

6. **Include Device Saves With Users**: Includes device type saves (Animal Crossing, for example) with users so finding them is easier and also makes it easier to differentiate and have multiple saves for different users on the same console.

7. **Auto Backup On Restore**: Makes JKSV automatically create a backup before restoring another backup just in case.

8. **Auto Name backups**: Automatically names backups and skips the keyboard entirely.

9. **Overclock/CPU Boost**: Overclocks the CPU when exporting ZIP archives. 

10. **Hold to Delete**: Whether or not you would like JKSV to force you to hold A to delete a backup.

11. **Hold to Restore**: Whether or not you would like JKSV to force you to hold A to restore a backup.

12. **Hold to Overwrite**: Whether or not you would like JKSV to force you to hold A to overwrite a backup on your SD card.

13. **Force Mount**: This controls whether or not JKSV displays everything it finds on your Switch, or only the save it can successfully open and mount.

14. **Account System Saves**: This controls whether or not JKSV displays system save data that has an account user ID associated with it or not. This is different than normal system save data because that does not have an account user ID associated with it.

15. **Enable Writing to System Saves**: This enables writing and restoring to system save data and the NAND partitions in the filebrowser mode. This is **dangerous** and should normally be left off. Any damage incurred with this option on is your own fault. 

16. **Use FS Commands Directly**: Uses the Switch's FS file functions instead of LibNX's fs_dev and stdio. This can _sometimes_ resolve some issues.

17. **Export Saves to Zip**: Uses ZIP files for backing up saves instead of unpacked files in folders. This has the benefit of higher compatibility with various edge-case saves with non-ASCII filenames which the SD card can't handle.

18. **Force English to be Used**: Overrides the detected language and uses the default English strings.

19. **Enable Trash Bin**: Enables moving backups deleted the `_TRASH_` folder instead of deleting them permanently. Just in case.

20. **Title Sorting Type**: Changes the way titles are sorted and displayed.

22. **Animation Scale**: Changes the transition speed for animated parts of the UI. One being instant, 8.0 being the slowest _I normally allow_.
